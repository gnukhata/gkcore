Main entry point:
This package initializer module is run when the application is served.
The module contains enum dict containing all gnukahta success and failure messages.
It also contains all the routes which are connected to respective resources.
To trace the link of the routes we look at the name of a route and then see where it appeares in any of the @view_defaults or @view_config decorator of any resource.
This module also scanns for the secret from the database which is then used for jwt authentication.
