# Merge strategy

Development happens on the `devel` branch. Create your feature branch from it, add your changes and make a merge request

`master` branch is intended for stable code. So, do not push changes to it.

# Release Strategy

Checklist:

1. Update IFSC & HSN codes
2. Git checkout to master
3. merge commits from devel -> master
4. Wait for the ci/cd pipeline to finish. Make sure all jobs are successful
5. Create a Release / tag
